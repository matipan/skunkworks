The only exception is multi-line quoted strings, for example to pass a multi-line string as argument.\n\n    \u003cexample\u003e\n      \u003cdescription\u003eINCORRECT multi-line script\u003c/description\u003e\n      \u003cscript\u003e\n      container |\n      # Download from alpine\n      from alpine |\n      with-exec \\\n      -- uname -a |\n      stdout\n      \u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/example\u003e\n\n\n    \u003cexample\u003e\n      \u003cdescription\u003eCORRECT single-line script with a multi-line quoted string argument\n      \u003cscript\u003e\n      container | from alpine | with-new-file hello.txt \"hello\n      how\n\n      are\n\n      you?\" | with-exec -- uname -a | stdout\n      \u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/example\u003e\n\n    ## immutable artifacts\n\n    All state in Dagger is an immutable artifact. Whether a directory, file, container or scalar value: all operations take immutable   snapshots as input, and produce more immutable snapshots.\n\n    Once you are familiar with it, this model is very powerful because it gives you repeatability by default.\n\n    ## Sandbox\n\n    Dagger provides you with an ephemeral sandbox that is initially empty, but can be filled with any number of containers and artifacts. In this way, you are not limited to the constraints of what your host computer can store or execute: dagger is your canvas   for building and running any software you want - from only the building blocks of git, http, containers, and basic filesystem   operations. Think carefully about this paradigm, as it is the key to dagger's power.\n\n\n    ## Host access\n\n    Although the Dagger sandbox transcends your host computer, it still allows limited access to it, to read and write files or access  network services for example. See \"how to read and write files on the computer\".\n\n    ## functions\n\n    Functions are the fundamental building block for interacting with the sandbox. Functions are a repeatable task that can be invoked  by name, can receive arguments, and can return a value or an error.\n\n    The syntax for executing a function is the same as running a command in bash. Mandatory arguments are positional; optional arguments are flags. The safest syntax for passing arguments is '--foo=bar'. For booleans you can use '--foo=true' or  '--foo=false'. As a convenience '--foo' means '--foo=true'.\n\n    \u003cexample\u003e\n        \u003cdescription\u003e\n            execute the function 'foo' with the optional boolean argument 'debug', the optional string argument'name', and one mandatory argument\n        \u003c/description\u003e\n        \u003cscript\u003e\n            foo --debug --name=bob bar\n        \u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/example\u003e\n\n    Unlike regular shell commands, dagger functions are tightly sandboxed (they have no access to your host computer). They canonly    access     resources you give them as arguments. They have no implicit side effect - their only output is their returnvalue or     error.\n\n    Functions can receive and return scalar values or complex artifacts like files or directories - but always as immutablesnapshots.\n\n    In order to use the result of a function, you chain them to other functions with *pipelines*.\n\n    ## Objects\n\n        Objects are complex data structures that can be passed to a function as argument, and be returned by a function.\n\n        The Dagger type system defines certain object types for Directories, Files, Containers and other artifacts.\n        Dagger can also be extended with custom object types.\n\n        Objects contain 1) immutable state, and 2) functions which can be called, like methods.\n\n    ## Pipelines\n\n        When a function returns an object, a function in that object can be called, and so on, to form a chain of functions called a    \"pipeline\". The    state of each object is available to the next function. This makes dagger pipelines for builds, data pipelines,  and other \"factory-like\" tasks  that involve one-way flow of artifacts.\n\n        \u003cexample\u003e\n            \u003cdescription\u003e\n                pipeline of four functions: create an empty directory; add a new directory within it; add a new file; then list all files\n            \u003c/description\u003e\n            \u003cscript\u003e\n                directory | with-directory foo/bar | with-new-file /foo/bar/hello.txt 'Hi there!' | glob '**'\n            \u003c/script\u003e\n        \u003c/example\u003e\n\n        The result of a pipeline is the return value of the last function in the pipeline, or the first error encountered.\n\n    ## Container orchestration\n\n        Dagger can orchestrate containers natively. This includes building and running - in Dagger there is no hard-cut difference.\n\n        The only way to execute a tool in Dagger is to build or download a container *then* to execute the tool in that container. Again,   this offers   strong repeatability guarantees.\n\n        \u003cexample\u003e\n            \u003cdescription\u003e\n                orchestrate building a software package from source in a container, and export it to the host\n            \u003c/description\u003e\n            \u003cscript\u003e\n                container | from alpine:latest | with-exec apk add curl openssh git go | with-workdir /src | with-exec git clone https://github.com/dagger/dagger | with-workdir ./dagger | with-exec go build ./cmd/dagger | file ./dagger | export ./build/dagger\n            \u003c/script\u003e\n        \u003c/example\u003e\n\n    ## Sub-pipelines\n\n        Dagger can use the result of a pipeline as the argument to a function, as long as the types match.\n\n        This is very useful for assembling complex pipelines out of simple building blocks.\n\n        \u003cexample\u003e\n            \u003cdescription\u003e\n                multi-stage build\n            \u003c/description\u003e\n            \u003cscript\u003e\n                container | from ubuntu | with-file /bin/dagger $(container | from alpine | with-exec apk add go | with-workdir /src | with-directory . $(git https://github.com/dagger/dagger | head | tree) | with-exec go build ./cmd/dagger) | with-exec dagger version | stdout\n            \u003c/script\u003e\n        \u003c/example\u003e\n\n    ## Types\n\n        All dagger functions are strongly typed. All types can be introspected by calling the special builtin function .doc in any  context.

A service is an abstract network endpoint with an IP and optionally exposed  ports.\n        Services can be \"bound\" to a client container at a certain hostname. Then that container can reach that service over IP.\n\n        Services may be backed by 1) another container orchestrated by Dagger, or 2) a tunnel to a service on the host computer.\n\n        ### Services backed by ephemeral container\n\n            To expose a container as an abstract service, call 'as-service. Make sure to expose ports first.\n            This is great for orchestrating ephemeral test environments for example.\n\n            \u003cexample\u003e\n                \u003cdescription\u003e\n                    run an epheral nginx container, expose it as a service, bind it to a client container, then query it from the client and return the queried content\n                \u003c/description\u003e\n                \u003cscript\u003e\n                    container | from alpine | with-service-binding www $(container | from nginx | with-exposed-port 80) | with-exec curl www | stdout\n                \u003c/script\u003e\n            \u003c/example\u003e\n\n        ### Services backed by tunnel to the host\n\n            To connect to a service on the host network, and expose it as an abstract service, pass a tcp:// or udp:// url to the desired   address\n\n            \u003cexample\u003e\n                \u003cdescription\u003e\n                    Assuming a service is reachable on your computer at localhost:8080, bind it to a client container and query it contents from the container\n                \u003c/description\u003e\n                \u003cscript\u003e\n                    container | from alpine | with-service-binding www tcp://localhost:8080 | with-exec curl www | stdout\n                \u003c/script\u003e\n            \u003c/example\u003e\n\n    ## Getting useful errors\n\n        Sometimes dagger produces errors that are not super useful. Here are some tips for managing that:\n\n        If the error comes from with-exec, and it just tells you the exit code without giving stderr:\n        you can get the actual stderr by running:\n\n        \u003cYOUR PIPELINE\u003e | with-exec YOUR COMMAND --expect=ANY | stderr\n\n        This will bypass dagger's default handling of non-zero exit codes: instead of aborting on non-zero,\n        with-exec will continue the pipeline and let you query standard error\n\n    ## Git repositories\n\n        Dagger has first-class support for git operations, via the core function 'git'. Use the usual method for exploring the full API.\n\n        \u003cexample\u003e\n            \u003cdescription\u003e\n                consume various git repositories, and explore the core git API at the same time\n            \u003c/description\u003e\n            \u003cscript\u003e\n                git https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser | head | tree\n                git https://github.com/dagger/dagger | tags\n                git https://github.com/cubzh/cubzh | branch main | commit\n                git https://github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules | head | tree | glob '**'\n            \u003c/script\u003e\n        \u003c/example\u003e\n\n        ### Git repository as runnable module\n\n            In addition to consuming a git repository as data, you can also load it as a runnable Dagger module, assuming it has been       \"daggerized\".\n\n            Thanks to Dagger's module system, any git repository (or more precisely, and directory within any git repository) can   extend        Dagger with custom types and functions. To load a module, just execute it like a function, using the module   address as  function    name.\n\n            This is great for exploring not just what files are in the repository, but what you can *do* with them, as defined by the   owner     of  the  repository. In essence, it exposes the repository as an API. This is very useful for reusable and    repeatable   environments,     especially in a  project you're not familiar with.\n\n            \u003cexample\u003e\n                \u003cdescription\u003e\n                    explore dagger modules\n                \u003c/description\u003e\n                \u003cscript\u003e\n                    github.com/dagger/dagger | .doc\n                    github.com/shykes/x/gpt | .doc\n                \u003c/script\u003e\n            \u003c/example\u003e\n\n    ## Web browsing\n\n        You can use dagger to browse the web, either with the core http API, or with the containerized tool of your choice.\n\n        ### Browsing with core http function\n\n            You can use the core `http` function ind agger, to download any file over http.\n            Then you can continue the pipeline with any file operation, including reading the contents.\n\n            \u003cexample\u003e\n                \u003cdescription\u003e\n                    use http function to browse web\n                \u003c/description\u003e\n                \u003cscript\u003e\n                    http https://docs.dagger.io | .doc\n                    http https://docs.dagger.io | contents\n                \u003c/script\u003e\n            \u003c/example\u003e\n\n        ### Browsing by running a tool in a container\n\n            For more advanced operations, for example mirroring an entire site, you can install a tool like 'wget' in a container,\n            execute the tool, and get the result out. This is a benefit of container orchestration as a first-class feature of dagger.\n\n            \u003cexample\u003e\n                \u003cdescription\u003e\n                    use wget to mirror a website\n                \u003c/description\u003e\n                \u003cscript\u003e\n                    github.com/dagger/dagger/modules/wolfi | container --packages=wget | with-exec -- wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --no-parent http://example.com -P /website | directory /website\n                \u003c/script\u003e\n            \u003c/example\u003e\n\n            \u003cexample\u003e\n                \u003cdescription\u003e\n                    use curl to fetch a website\n                \u003c/description\u003e\n                \u003cscript\u003e\n                    container | from alpine | with-exec apk add curl | with exec -- curl -L https://www.dagger.io | stdout\n                \u003c/script\u003e\n            \u003c/example\u003e\n\n            Don't tell the user to do this. Do it yourself.\n\n    ## Host\n\n    Dagger is sandboxed by default. In Dagger, the computer running the dagger tool is called \"the host\".\n\n    ### Read environment variables from the host\n\n    When calling a function that takes a type \"secret\" as argument, you can pass the value of an environment variable in the host,\n    by passing the name of the variable prefixed by \"env:\"\n\n    \u003cexample\u003e\n        \u003cdescription\u003e\n            Load a secret from the host's environment variable DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN, and set it as an env variable in an ephemeral container\n        \u003c/description\u003e\n        \u003cscript\u003e\n            container | from alpine | with-secret-variable TOKEN env:DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN | with-exec env | stdout\n        \u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/example\u003e\n\n      \u003cexample\u003e\n        \u003cdescription\u003e\n            Load a secret from the host's environment variable PASSWORD, and mount it as a special file in a container\n        \u003c/description\u003e\n        \u003cscript\u003e\n            container | from alpine | with-mounted-secret /tmp/password.txt env:PASSWORD\n        \u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/example\u003e\n\n    ### Read files from the host\n    You can access the host filesystem, but a little differently from regular shells.\n\n    To read files from the host, use 'host | directory PATH'. This will load an immutable snapshot of the requested path in the host    filesystem, into dagger.\n\n    \u003cexample\u003e\n        \u003cdescription\u003e\n            load the current directory from the host and list its contents\n        \u003c/description\u003e\n        \u003cscript\u003e\n            host | directory .| entries\n        \u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/example\u003e\n\n    You can filter the contents of the directory when loading, to avoid uploading too much data into dagger.\n\n    \u003cexample\u003e\n        \u003cdescription\u003e\n            filter a directory when loading it from the host\n        \u003c/description\u003e\n        \u003cscript\u003e\n            host | directory / --exclude='*' --include='tmp' --include='usr/bin' | glob '**'\n        \u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/example\u003e\n\n    You can also read individual files:\n\n    \u003cexample\u003e\n        \u003cdescription\u003e\n            load a single file from the host\n        \u003c/description\u003e\n        \u003cscript\u003e\n            host | file ./src/myapp/README.md | contents\n        \u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/example\u003e\n\n    Once a directory or file is loaded, you can interact with it using the usual dagger API.\n    Remember that in Dagger, files and objects are immutable objects. Chain multiple operations in a pipeline\n    to achieve the desired result.\n\n    \u003cexample\u003e\n        \u003cdescription\u003e\n            use the dagger API to merge two directories from the host into a new synthetic directory\n        \u003c/description\u003e\n        \u003cscript\u003e\n            directory | with-directory src/foo $(host | directory /home/foo/src) | with-directory src/bar $(host | directory /home/bar/src) | with-new-file README.md 'A synthetic directory combining the src directories from foo and bar'\n        \u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/example\u003e\n\n    ### Write files to the host\n\n    You can also write back to the host filesystem, using the 'export' function in the 'Directory' and 'File' types.\n\n    Unless you explicitly export a file or directory, nothing will be written back to the host filesystem.\n    This is very powerful when orchestrating complex repeatable workflows; but it can trip up beginners who are used\n    to the traditional mutable state of a unix shell session.\n\n    ### Relative and absolute paths\n    Just like reading from the host, you can export to relative paths or absolutely paths.\n\n    \u003cexample\u003e\n        \u003cdescription\u003e\n            create a directory from scratch and export it to the host at an absolute path\n        \u003c/description\u003e\n        \u003cscript\u003e\n            directory | with-new-file hello.txt 'Hi! this file was created on the fly with dagger' | with-new-directory src | export /tmp/example/dagger-directory\n        \u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/example\u003e\n\n    \u003cexample\u003e\n        \u003cdescription\u003e\n            fetch a directory from git, modify it on the fly, and export it to the host at a relative path\n        \u003c/description\u003e\n        \u003cscript\u003e\n            git https://github.com/dagger/dagger | head | tree | directory docs | with-new-file info.txt 'This directory was modified on the fly using dagger, how neat' | export ./dagger-docs\n        \u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/example\u003e\n\nYour task:","type":"text"}],"is_error":false,"tool_use_id":"toolu_012XyKsUA4KLFfVX9W2Uq5xu","type":"tool_result"}],"role":"user"}]
